Backup 3
========

I've stopped releasing builds of the Backup gem since it seemed unnecessary after all, and frequently pushing out 0.0.x versions is fine with me ( and anyone else I assume ). Please issue the following command from now on to get the latest backup versions:

    gem install backup

Thanks!
