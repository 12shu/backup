# Backup Configuration file for "Amazon S3 Backups"
# This file was generated with the Backup Generator

# 
# If you wish to make use of the Amazon S3 service to store your
# backups, use this configuration file.
# 
# Step by Step
# 
# Step 1
#  Choose the adapter you would like to use to back up your files
#  (MySQL, SQLite3, Assets or something Custom)
# 
# Step 2
#  Fill in the values for the adapter you choose.
#  You do not need to fill in the values for every adapter,
#  only the ones you are going to use. The rest you can leave untouched or remove.
# 
# Step 3
#  Once you've filled in all values, you are ready to execute the rake task that
#  starts that backup process. Above each Adapter you will see what rake task should
#  be run to start the backup process for that specific Adapter.
#
# Step 4
#  Once set up, you could set these rake tasks up in a cronjob to execute it periodically.
#  For handling this, I recommend using the javan-whenever gem
# 
#  See here: http://github.com/javan/whenever
